# Capstone Project

### Abstract 				
Using Twitter data, this capstone project takes public opinion as a proxy for community's attitude towards immigrants, and by consequence the predicted success of their integration. The goal is to produce a tool that can be used to visualize the differences in public opinion towards immigrants in different districts in England (through a geographical map). Ultimately, it could be beneficial to further relate community’s attitude to migrant integration and other related facts/events (e.g. reported racial discrimination in the area, job security, education level of immigrants etc...), and raise public awareness of the importance of creating a welcoming environment.
